# INGRESS DEFINITION
# ===
# This will allow traffic coming from the cluster to be mapped to our service.
---
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1 # mind this
# look the docs for the appropriate apiVersion
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  # again, suffixing stuff for brain sake
  name: httpbin-ingress
  # notice here, we want to use the same "universe" defined in httpbin.yml
  namespace: httpbin-ns
  # this is interesting, with this we tell the cluster to
  # take the matching requests according to the rules below
  # and redirect them as strip the matching path (/abc)
  annotations:
    # this annotation is documented in https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/v1.7/configuration/backends/kubernetes/#annotations
    traefik.ingress.kubernetes.io/rule-type: PathPrefixStrip
  # Ingresses don't have labels apparently
# Ingress definition
spec:
  # an ingress definition is comprised of rules
  rules:
  - http: # don't quite know if that http is a magic word or not
    # each http has paths to match
      paths:
      # each path, will be used to do the mapping
      - path: /abc
        pathType: Prefix
        # the backend section tells where to route the matched request
        backend:
          # we want to throw the request at our service
          service:
            # this is the one in httpbin_service.yml
            name: httpbin-load-balancer
            port:
              # this is the one in httpbin_service.yml too
              number: 8100
