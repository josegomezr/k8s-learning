# SERVICE DEFINITION
# ===
# Services exposes our pods so we can access them from outside the cluster
# (no tunneling or network dark magic skills required).
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  # mind -load-balancer, we'll use this name for the ingress definition later.
  name: httpbin-load-balancer
  # notice here, we want to use the same "universe" defined in httpbin.yml
  namespace: httpbin-ns
  # We'll use this later for filtering resources
  labels:
    target: httpbin
# This is the actual definition of the service
spec:
  # service type load balancer is used with cloud providers to get an
  # ip/hostname to access the pods. The ingress (later defined) will
  # link to this.
  type: LoadBalancer
  ports:
  - name: http
    protocol: TCP
    port: 8100 # this is the port we want to expose for the service
    # funny enough THIS PORT can't be repeated, I learned it afterwards.
    # so you have to use unique ports here (at least in my single-node k3s
    # server).
    targetPort: 80 # this is the port exposed in the pods.
  # Mind here, httpbin-app is the name defined in httpbin_deployment.yml
  selector:
    app: httpbin-app
